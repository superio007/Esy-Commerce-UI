How did AI Involve into this tech juggernaut?</span></p><p><strong>Importance of Research</strong></p><p><span data-contrast=\"none\">The current AI hype, powered by these Large Language Models or LLMs,&nbsp; started with a research paper. It came from the University of Toronto, authored by Geoffrey Hinton- the “Godfather of modern AI” – along with Ilya Sutskever of Open AI fame and Alex Krizhevsky (that's where the name AlexNet comes from).They took an old AI algorithm and sort of supercharged it using just two NVIDIA GPUs.</span></p><p><span data-contrast=\"none\">But here's the key word: RESEARCH.How many Universities do you know&nbsp; in India known for their cutting edge, competition winning or patent awarded, commercially implementable research in Artificial Intelligence?</span></p><p><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"><strong>&nbsp;India's Resource Constraints</strong></span></p><p><span data-contrast=\"none\">India does not have the resources; because India ALWAYS exports it's best resources.</span></p><p><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/mlNBw7HfvG0?si=W8cn_dH76rZhkBgY\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></p><p><span data-contrast=\"none\">look at the top AI researchers around the world almost everyone belongs to the Silicon Valley.And if you go through the history, you will understand that the researchers or the scientists are the main players of the entirety of the AI ecosystem.Frank Rosenblatt, who invented the perceptron, Geffory Hinton who gave the idea of back propagation algorithm, Yann LeCun who developed the Convolutional Neural Network or Fie-Fie-Li who created images dataset platform ImageNet – they were all researchers.Now if you see, these people belong to the USA and the universities out there. Although Geffory is from UK and LeCun from France, later they shifted to the US.Let's call it the Silicon Valley Talent Vacuum.</span></p><p><strong>The Silicon Valley Talent Vacuum</strong></p><p><span data-contrast=\"none\">This vacuum isn't just sucking in researchers. Look at the CEOs of major tech companies: Sundar Pichai at Google, Satya Nadella at Microsoft, Shantanu Narayen at Adobe. What do they have in common? They're all of Indian origin. But that's the word origin.</span><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-59457015\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">This CEOs</span></a><span data-contrast=\"none\">are also part of a four million-strong minority group that is among the wealthiest and most educated in the US. About a million of them are scientists and engineers.</span></p><p><span data-contrast=\"none\">In fact, Indians make up a huge chunk of the tech workforce in the US. over 70% of H-1B visas – you know which were work permits for skilled foreigners – go to software engineers. And in tech hubs like Seattle? Almost 40% of foreign-born engineers are from India.</span></p><p><span data-contrast=\"none\">So why is this happening? Two words: money and opportunity.</span></p><p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Between 2013 and 2023, the US poured a mind-boggling $335 billion into AI. And India? Just about $9 billion. That's less than 3% of what the US invested. It's like bringing a slingshot to a laser gun fight.And the gap is only widening. I</span><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/30/here-are-indias-biggest-ai-startups-based-on-how-much-money-theyve-raised/#:~:text=In%20contrast%2C%20AI%20startup%20funding,invested%20in%20Indian%20AI%20startups.\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">n 2023</span></a><span data-contrast=\"none\">alone, US AI startups raised $16.2 billion Dollars. In India $113.4 million. That's less than 1% of what the US raai NEWSised in a single year.</span></p><p><span data-contrast=\"none\">This brings us to our second factor: the infrastructure</span></p><p><span data-contrast=\"none\">The backbone of modern AI isn't just brainpower – it's computing power. And who controls that? Well largely the US tech giants. Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure – these American companies dominate the cloud computing market, providing the raw power needed for AI development.But there's a twist in this tale. These cloud giants aren't just selling services – they're investing in AI startups, who then become their customers. It's a cycle that some call “revenue round-tripping.” But that the different topic all togheter.</span></p><p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Take Amazon's $4 billion Dollar investment in Anthropic, an AI startup. Part of the deal? Anthropic uses Amazon's cloud services. Google and Microsoft have similar arrangements with other AI companies.Oracle also became a cloud partner for Cohere after investing in the startup.This creates a closed loop that's hard for outsiders to break into. And it's not just about the software. Nvidia, the company that makes these powerful chips. You know what their market cap is? It's almost as much as India's entire GDP. One company, less than 30,000 employees, is worth nearly as much as a country of 1.4 billion people.</span></p><p><span data-contrast=\"none\">So where does this leave India?</span></p><p><strong>India's AI Potential</strong></p><p><span data-contrast=\"none\">India gives birth to the talent. But that talent is being sucked away by the Silicon Valley Vacuum. India lacks the massive investments and infrastructure needed to compete at the highest levels of AI development.But here's where the story takes another interesting turn.</span></p><p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Remember how we talked about the early days of SaaS in India? Well, the AI startup scene in India today is reminiscent of these times. Funding might be constrained, but there's a buzz of activity.Take a look at these</span><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/30/here-are-indias-biggest-ai-startups-based-on-how-much-money-theyve-raised/\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">startups</span></a><span data-contrast=\"none\">:Krutrim, India's first AI unicorn, is valued at $1 billion. Sarvam AI, building language models for Indian languages. Mad Street Den, is creating AI solutions for global enterprises.These startups are doing something interesting. They're not just trying to replicate what Silicon Valley is doing. They're solving uniquely Indian problems, like creating AI models that understand India's very many languages.Dev Khare, a partner at Lightspeed Venture Partners India, puts it this way:</span></p><blockquote><p><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(97,119,152);font-family:Montserrat;font-size:16px;\"><span style=\"-webkit-text-stroke-width:0px;display:inline !important;float:none;font-style:normal;font-variant-caps:normal;font-variant-ligatures:normal;font-weight:400;letter-spacing:normal;orphans:2;text-align:start;text-decoration-color:initial;text-decoration-style:initial;text-decoration-thickness:initial;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;widows:2;word-spacing:0px;\">You have to take a risk and say, ‘This is where the world will be in a few years from now. That market doesn’t exist today, but I’m goanna bet it exists. I’m going to build for that.’ That’s a bit of a newer DNA for India.”ai</span></span></p></blockquote><p><span data-contrast=\"none\">So, can India compete in the AI wars? The odds are stacked against it. The funding gap is massive, the brain drain is real, and the infrastructure lag is significant.But just when you think India story's over, there's a plot twist.</span></p><p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Remember CP Gurnani, the CEO who challenged Sam Altman's claim? Well, he wasn't just talking big. He was cooking up something in the background.In just five months, and with less than $5 million – that's pocket change in Silicon Valley terms – Tech Mahindra developed an Indian Large Language Model. And not just for one language, but for local languages and over 37 dialects.</span></p><p><span data-contrast=\"none\">This project, called Project Indus, isn't just about proving Altman wrong. It's about something bigger. It's about being “Atmanirbhar” or self-reliant.They're teaming up with big names like Dell Technologies and Intel to make it happen.The goal? To bridge the linguistic gap and let millions of Indians interact with AI in their native tongues. This is where India might have an edge.While Silicon Valley is busy creating one-size-fits-all solutions, India is focus on its unique challenges. It's not just about competing – it's about solving problems that matter to over a billion people.</span></p><p><span data-contrast=\"none\">India's got something unique. It's got a massive pool of engineering talent, a huge domestic market to test new ideas, and now, a growing ecosystem of AI startups that are taking on challenges that Silicon Valley might overlook entirelyAs Gurnani puts it, the secret sauce for Indian companies is</span></p><blockquote><p><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(97,119,152);font-family:Montserrat;font-size:16px;\"><span style=\"-webkit-text-stroke-width:0px;display:inline !important;float:none;font-style:normal;font-variant-caps:normal;font-variant-ligatures:normal;font-weight:400;letter-spacing:normal;orphans:2;text-align:start;text-decoration-color:initial;text-decoration-style:initial;text-decoration-thickness:initial;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;widows:2;word-spacing:0px;\">“frugal plus innovation plus technology plus people leadership.”</span></span></p></blockquote>",

In march 2023, they wanted to do something mind-blowing for their 150th anniversary and with all the hype around AI, they decided to do something radical – they made beer without a brew master with the help of Chat GPT. Even the marketing department had some fun by leaning on Midjourney to design the beer’s branding and marketing. Seed to sip, everything was just AI-generated magic. In order to come up with the ‘Beck’s Autonomous Beer’, it’s not like they told the AI how to do it or anything like that. The AI just went ahead and made its own beer. Beck’s says,</p><blockquote><p>&nbsp;‘we did not create autonomous, autonomous created itself…’</p></blockquote><p>A beer with 5% alcohol by volume and pilsner style brew. Beck’s have pioneered innovations like the use of the iconic green beer bottles, introducing non-alcoholic beer, and this time, the AI generated beer. Autonomous was made available in Italy, Germany and UK in very limited supplies, and it was sold out in almost 10 minutes. This exclusive beer was available on a microsite as a limited edition product. We really hope they plan to roll it out again in the future though, as Beck’s marketing director, Laura Salway explained,</p><blockquote><p>“It was just a trial run with 450 cans. She stated, “the beer giant is looking to the future and planning new ways to engage and excite customers and create revolutionary beer..”</p></blockquote><p><strong>How did they do it?</strong></p><p>Beck’s did all of all of this with something known known as ‘compound prompting’.</p><p>It is a technique used in natural language processing and artificial intelligence, particularly in language models like GPT-3, GPT-4 etc. Where, instead of throwing a single question at it, you chat up with the AI by giving a bunch of instructions or queries one after the other. This way, you get a smoother and more contextually on-point response. Basically, the idea behind it is to maintain a conversational flow with the AI by giving it a sequence of related inputs.</p><p>Beck’s team sat down for a kick-off conversation with the AI. They explained about their pioneering spirit, ambition and asked for ideas to celebrate the 150th anniversary. And guess what? The AI didn’t disappoint! After a deep, meaningful chat, the AI suggested something groundbreaking – an anniversary beer entirely crafted by AI. Beck’s, being the adventurous bunch that they are, decided to roll with it. The AI gave them a perfect recipe blend out of millions of potential combinations. It created a recipe that uses local German produce and 100% natural ingredients. Beck’s started brewing up the recipe with their master brewers. While the recipe was brewing the AI came up with a name ‘Autonomous’. Because, you know, beer pretty much created itself. Makes sense, right? Expanding on the same concept, they asked autonomous to write a mission statement. It’s like the beer had its own personality.</p><p>With all these elements in place, beck’s wanted to visualize it. So, they asked autonomous to design a logo that brought their concept to life. And voila! Tagline? “The beer that made itself.” Autonomous, now armed with a recipe, name, mission statement, and logo, created a can design that perfectly captured the essence of the beer, ‘a hybrid between half glass, half aluminum’ autonomous wouldn’t stop there. They asked it to create its own website, considering all the information that it already had. Now that the product was ready beck’s wanted to sell the exclusive edition to the world. They asked the ai to consider its audience and, boom! Posters, billboards, and social media ads were ready to roll. AB InBev the multinational beverage and brewing company that owns beck’s revealed that it also used AI to prepare all of the assets for its advertising campaign, such as generating imagery and a revolving 360 video of the newly developed container.</p><p>How does autonomous sound? Well, they asked the ai to not only write but also voice its own radio ad. It’s like the beer is promoting itself! Autonomous didn’t just stop at that. It came up with a full advertising video script, telling its own story, crafted to the last detail with AI magic to bring it to life. At last, the AI even had its own marketing strategy, including influencers, and suggested lines for them to use.</p><p>Pioneering the AI generated beer, autonomous proved that AI is not just a tool; it’s a creative force capable of conceiving, brewing, and marketing a unique beverage. You can feel it, smell it, and most importantly, taste it. Going forward we can imagine combining this revolutionary spirit of beck’s with an interactive and personalized twist. Imagine that you are having an AI generated drink that is customized by your suggestions, feedback and history. Hold on to your mugs! Because Intelligentx, a food and beverage company from London has achieved this a few years back.</p><p><strong>IntelligentX Customizable Beer</strong></p><p>IntelligentX, produced the world’s first beer brewed by artificial intelligence. It was able to create flavors based on your suggestions and feedback. All this happened with a hidden AI system behind a Facebook messenger bot – it’s like the bartender of the future! IntelligentX said</p><blockquote><p>“the use of AI would help brewers receive and test customer feedback more quickly than ever before..”</p></blockquote><p>If you ever have grab one of these unique bottles, you can check out the code on it. That’s your ticket to the future of beer! You scan it, and boom, the bot starts asking you questions about your beer preferences – flavors, ratings, and so on. It’s like having a conversation with the ultimate brew master. Now, that’s the genius part. As the AI learns from your feedback it also asks you better questions for the next time. It’s like a never-ending improvement cycle for your taste buds. But wait, there’s more!</p><p>The AI uses something called reinforcement learning. It’s like a gaming system for beer, where the AI gets rewarded for making you happy. If you love those hoppy beers or thick stouts, the AI’s got your back! And guess what? All this feedback goes into a virtual room with the brewer. It’s like we’re all having a massive beer-tasting party, and the AI is the ultimate host. The AI is about putting all the customers in the same room as a brewer. And that’s exactly how it all feels like. Imagine the insane amount of data that they’re collecting. Even if a human couldn’t do it in a lifetime, they wouldn’t be able to act on it. But that’s exactly the magic of AI or we would say science.</p><p>While beck’s autonomous showcases the power of AI creativity, IntelligentX exemplifies the AI’s ability to adapt, learn, and enhance your beer-drinking experience. Together, these stories paint a vivid picture of the future of brewing – one where artificial intelligence not only creates but also personalizes our favorite beverages. So, buckle up for a journey through the intersection of innovation and taste, where each bottle becomes a portal to the cutting-edge technology and to the beer craftsmanship.</p><p><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/-R_dDGRr3RQ?si=nX3Otn1Ge3CnUOBU\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></p>",

Prominent figures like the former Citigroup chief Vikram Pandit have predicted back in 2018 that substantial portions of banking jobs, ranging from 30% to even 50 and 70%, could be replaced by AI in the next few years. So, has it happened already? From analyzing contracts in seconds to emojis helping you manage your finances, we have got some mind blowing innovations to talk about. So feel free to share this article with your team on LinkedIn.</p><h3>JP Morgan – Contract Intelligence</h3><p>Picture the verbose and arguably boring world of legal contracts and agreements. It’s time consuming, error prone and frankly, a bit tedious. But what if we could change that? What if we could automate this task of contract reviewing? Well, hold on to your hats, because JP Morgan has done just that.</p><p>JP Morgan Chase is the largest bank in the United States and the world’s largest bank by market cap. They have introduced something called contract intelligence, or COiN for short. And COiN isn’t your mom’s legal software. It’s armed with machine learning and natural language processing, or NLP. It can analyze complex legal documents and extract crucial information in a fraction of the time it takes for a human to do the same thing. JP Morgan says that lawyers spent an upward of jaw dropping 360,000 hours every year deciphering commercial credit agreements.This was, of course, before COiN came along, and that’s not it. This technology operates on a private cloud network called Gaia, which also was developed in house by JP Morgan Chase.</p><p>How does it work? It employs something called an unsupervised machine learning process, which means after it has been set up with the algorithms and fed with the annotated training data, you know, the kind of work that we do at&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.esycommerce.com/\">Esycommerce</a>, there’s very little need for humans to be involved. The essential technique used here to compare and distinguish between different agreements is called optical character recognition, or OCR. Based on the training datasets of historical contracts, and by recognizing patterns in words and their locations in the contracts, COiN identifies clauses, terms, legal language, and their repercussions. It can even spot discrepancies and anomalies within contracts, streamlining legal processes for a more focused and efficient approach. But that’s just the tip of the iceberg.</p><p>JP Morgan is all in on AI apparently. They’ve set up tech centers dedicated to big data, robotics and cloud infrastructure. Zames Matt, the former chief operating officer over at JPM, mentioned how this system is giving them and their developers a major boost in productivity. And the cherry on top? It’s actually saving them a good chunk of capital.</p><p>The bank has involved the best AI talents around the globe in the last few years. They have assembled the likes of Manuela Veloso, who has been the head of AI research at JPM since the July of 2018, while Dr. Samina Shah operates as the managing director in the AI research organization at JPMorgan. Then there’s Tucker Balch, a respected AI researcher from Georgia Tech who was hired as the managing director of AI research in 2019. With hiring moves like these, JPM is making it clear that this isn’t just a phase, it’s a financial AI revolution.</p><h3>PayPal- Fraud Detection</h3><p>Ever tried giving money to a distressed Nigerian prince? Don’t worry, because apparently you’re not alone. As digital transactions soar, so does the risk of cybercrime. But here’s where AI steps in, and PayPal is leading the charge. PayPal, which once pioneered digital payments, has taken proactive steps to safeguard its customers.</p><p>Over the last few years, they have put a lot of effort into artificial intelligence and data analytics to make sure that they can handle risks better to keep their customers safe. In 2018, PayPal acquired Simility, a fraud detection startup, and this move allowed them to strengthen their risk assessment and fraud prevention capabilities. After PayPal got their hands on Simility, Bill Ready, PayPal’s then chief operating officer pointed out how PayPal solutions used to have a one size fits all approach. They wouldn’t always fit with the specific needs of different merchants out there. But now, with Simility in the picture, it’s like a whole new ballgame.</p><p>PayPal can actually give merchants more power to take charge and tackle fraudulent transactions head on. They have integrated fraud protection into PayPal commerce platform. This integration comes with a user friendly dashboard interface. The platform provides tailored fraud filters based on each merchant’s specific business data that they generate. Once they start using the platform, merchants can also assess the effects of these filters on past data before putting them into action.</p><p>The system constantly offers suggestion for improvement to enhance the effectiveness of these filters. The best part is that they are not reacting to fraud they are predicting and preventing it. Their secrete sauce! Graph Analysis. You see graph analysis is like putting together a puzzle. But this puzzle reveals the connections between buyers and sellers and their extended networks as well the connection in these payment networks can strongly predict behaviors and serve as excellent signs of risk thus detecting potential fraud.</p><p>However, as PayPal claims, these relationships are too huge to traverse and analyze if they were to be stored in a relational database. The company uses something called a graph analysis. It allows PayPal to create a payments graph that shows the transactions between buyers and sellers. Through graph analysis, PayPal can identify unauthorized access gained by a user account. By examining the connections and the patterns in the graph, it can predict whether a buyer is likely to engage with a seller that is deemed risky based on their existing connections and historical patterns within the graph. It can also forecast future interaction through graph analysis. It’s like having an AI Sherlock Homes detecting fraud before it even happens. There are two types of graph analysis at play discrete and connected.</p><p><strong>Discrete graph Analysis:</strong>&nbsp;It focuses on individual items that could be buyers, sellers, transactions and other related elements. The goal is to assess the risk associated with each entity by analyzing their associations and connections. For example, consider a buyer with a history of fraud or suspicious activity. If this buyer frequently interacts with another specific seller, the algorithm may examine that behavior and can flag that buyer as potentially risky based on his negative history.</p><p><strong>Connected Graph Analysis:</strong>&nbsp;It zooms out to see the bigger picture. It’s like solving a mystery by connecting the dots. This type of analysis considers how entities are interconnected and how the graph as a whole functions. Various graph algorithms are used to extract meaningful information from graph’s interconnected data. By applying various graph algorithms like Page rank connected components, clustering centrality algorithms, analysts can uncover insights such as influential sellers, distinct communities of users, and potential ring frauds as well. For example, a group of fraudsters operating from the same IP address could raise alarms for all transactions originating from similar ranges of IP’s in the same geographical vicinity.</p><p>You see, PayPal’s proactive approach isn’t about safeguarding your money, it’s about gaining your trust. And guess what? They are the first foreign payment platform approved for online services in China, a country that finds extremely hard to trust anything that isn’t born out of China itself. Impressive, Right!</p><h3>Capital One: ENO</h3><p>Now, let’s switch gear to customer interactions and chatbots. We have all encountered them, but Capital one, a US based financial corporation, took it a step further with their user friendly chatbot, ENO. In 2017, Capital One launched ENO, the world’s first natural language SMS based text assistant. What sets ENO apart is its ability to understand emojis and natural language, making it a breeze to have interactions with.</p><p>ENO uses something called a natural language processor to understand the different ways a human can talk about their money and their bank accounts. If you need to ask it about your bank balance, you don’t need to say the words, “What is my account balance?” Rather, you could just say, “How much money do I have?” or just send a money bag emoji either way it can answer your query. It has been trained to understand over 2,200 terms and emojis people use to ask about their account balances. Capital One’s AI team put in the hard work to ensure that ENO understands human nuances avoiding technical jargon all along.</p><blockquote><p>“..creating the sophisticated NLP architecture to ensure ENO could understand nuances in human communication took an amazing amount of hard work creativity and collaboration..” -Margaret Mayer, the then vice president of software engineering at Capital One</p></blockquote><p>How was ENO trained?<br>Firstly they pre-trained ENO with unsupervised learning techniques. It was trained with the chat generated from web chats between customer service representatives and real customers. It helped ENO to understand the similarities and attach meaning to the words generated within these conversations. Next it was trained with a supervised machine learning model using labeled data. It helped ENO to understand the tens of thousands of words and phrases customers had used previously. For example, when a customer wanted to activate a card he could have said, ‘Activate’, ‘turn on card’ or ‘make my card work.’</p><p>Finally an additional supervised learning was applied to new utterances so that ENO could understand terms that had been never used before. ENO not only recognizes similar terms and sentences but can also understand misspellings, abbreviations such as ‘pymt’ for payment, ‘Acct number’ for account number, hashtag (#) so on and so forth. And to add more to the human side of it, ENO also answers questions related to life and when that doesn’t work it can also crack jokes. Here’s the kicker, the team has also built a conversational context into ENO to make it feel like a friendly companion. It can pick up conversations right where you left off making interactions more human and engaging. So if you leave a conversation right in the middle for whatever reasons, don’t worry ENO understands! It can continue the chat being on the same page whenever you’re ready.</p><p>There you have it guys, AI is revolutionizing banking and finance industry in ways we couldn’t have imagined. From JP Morgan’s contract intelligence to PayPal’s fraud detection and capital One’s ENO chatbot the Innovations in AI and machine learning are enhancing efficiency, trust as well as customer experiences. And don’t let the fear of job losses overshadow the potential, as JP Morgan’s Chief Information Officer Dana Deasy wisely puts it, “AI is about freeing people to work on higher value tasks opening up new opportunities.” So as AI continues to evolve let’s embrace this transformative journey together.</p><p><iframe title=\"YouTube video player\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/9TPT0PrkI7c?si=3cNCZZL5IuGPfDOS&amp;controls=0\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></iframe></p>",

In this they demonstrated the first mathematical model of neural networks.</p><p><img src=\"https://historyofinformation.com/images/Screen_Shot_2020-09-09_at_6.46.46_AM_big.png\" alt=\"Walter Pitts and Warren Mcculloch\" width=\"285\" height=\"300\"> <img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*fDHlg9iNo0LLK4czQqqO9A.png\" alt=\"&quot;Mathematical\"><br><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.historyofinformation.com/detail.php?entryid=782\">Source: History of Information</a></p><p>Commonly referred to as the Mcculloch-Pitts neuron this model mimics the functionality of a biological neuron. It demonstrates how a mental process like learning takes place with the help of neural connections. It’s important to notice at this time that tits had not received a University degree when he came up with the idea of an artificial neuron. In fact he wasn’t even an official student. He educated himself by assisting many science Scholars such as Rudolph Carnap and Warren Mcculloch himself. The only degree he later received was an Associates of Arts degree offered by the University of Chicago for this very work with Mcculloch as an unofficial student. The model works on Boolean logic that uses the AND, OR, NOT, XOR and XNOR functions (Boolean logic is a system where there are two inputs and one outputs and depending on which one of these inputs is on or off determines what the output is going to be). During these times devices could only perform commands and did not store any kind of data or results for future predictions and although this original model was limited to two types of inputs it was an important step towards what came next.</p><p><strong>Practice Made Neuron Perfect</strong></p><p>later in 1949 a Canadian psychologist named Donald Hebb theorized about the synaptic connections in a human’s neuron. It was the first time when a psychological learning rule for synaptic change in neuron was introduced that came to be known as the ‘Hebb’s Synapse.’</p><p><img

Brain</a></p><p>His theory explained how a neuron can strengthen a learning pattern into a learned behavior or habit when it performs the same task again and again or develops a sustainable thought pattern for a very long time. Essentially he theorized that our brain cells are just like us, they need to do a task repeatedly in a fixed or a mixed pattern in order to learn something. Mcculloch and pits later developed a cell assembly theory in the 1951 paper and their model was then known as Hebbian Theory, which was very much based on Hebb’s previous discovery. Any machine learning model that followed this idea was said to exhibit a Hebbian learning. This theory served as a watershed movement for research in the field of machine learning. By 1950 a more&nbsp; serious effort in this field started to take root to examine whether a machine can generate answers like humans. The British mathematician Alan Turing, yes the one from the imitation game played by Benedict Cumberbatch came up with a Turing Test.</p><p><strong>The Turing Test</strong></p><p>Alan Turing was a mathematician and computer scientist from London who made an important contribution to machine learning. Turing is already well known for his work during World War II when he upgraded the Polish machine BOMB that more effectively decoded the complex coded messages sent by Germans to their spies in England. post-war he continued to develop his ideas about computer science and published a paper titled ‘<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://redirect.cs.umbc.edu/courses/471/papers/turing.pdf\">Computing Machinery and Intelligence’</a>.</p><p><img src=\"https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/I5CfndyuhsUMtCKxTsC9Pw6GUfo=/fit-in/1098x968/top/filters:format_auto():upscale()/2013/09/23/133/n/1922507/87e433ccf3b57440_benedict-cumberbatch-as-alan-turing.jpg\" alt=\"Alan Turing\" width=\"305\" height=\"269\"><img src=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DgYdZ0FWkAIwgVc.jpg\" alt=\"Computing machinery and intelligence\" width=\"325\" height=\"251\"><br><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.popsugar.com/tech/alan-turing-biography-31915742\">Source: PopSugar</a></p><p>This paper proposed the idea of the imitation game which later became the Turing test a simple test of examining if a machine can think like humans. Alan believed that in about 50 years time it will be possible to program computers with a storage capacity of around 109 megabytes to make them play the imitation game so well that an average interrogator will not have more than 70% chance of making the right identification between a computer and a human response. Wouldn’t you know it by 2014 a Chabot named&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.zdnet.com/article/computer-chatbot-eugene-goostman-passes-the-turing-test/\">Eugene Goostman</a>&nbsp;passed the Turing test by convincing 33% of the jury members that he was a 17 year old Ukrainian boy and not a machine. Further in 1951 a cognitive and computer scientist named Marvin Minsky started to work on his idea of creating a learning machine. This machine is considered one of the first pioneering attempts in the field of artificial intelligence.</p><p><strong>First Artificial Neural Network</strong></p><p>As a student Marvin Minsky dreamt of creating a machine that could learn. He wanted to better understand intelligence by recreating it but the machine he imagined had many technical requirements that were very expensive and needed funding. To bring his device Minsky secured funding from the Harvard psychologist George Miller. Therefore with the help of fellow Princeton graduate Dean Edmonds, he created the first artificial neural network called SNARK or Stochastic Neural Analog Reinforcement Calculator. The design included 50 random interconnected neurons that were inspired with the Habbian learning. The main aim was to make the system learn through possessing past memory. To make this happen Minsky and Edmonds tested its learning capabilities by having the machine navigate a virtual maze. Now that’s because a maze problem has multiple Solutions or roots that can take us successfully to the exit. But the best way is the one that takes the least amount of time. Therefore the neurons in SNARK were trained randomly to solve the maze. Every result that gave more information to the neurons about which move was probably correct and which one was probably wrong. Thus, eventually realizing the best route by training itself on multiple combinations neurons developed a pattern and studied their own pattern to come out with the best case solution.</p><p><img src=\"https://bostonglobalforum.org/aiwsin/wp-content/uploads/sites/18/2020/09/SNARC.png\" alt=\"SNARK\" width=\"596\" height=\"417\"><br><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://aiws.net/the-history-of-ai/this-week-in-the-history-of-ai-at-aiws-net-marvin-minsky-and-dean-edmonds-built-snarc-the-first-artificial-neural-network/\">Source: AIWS.net</a></p><p>Typically computers were trained to solve solution-based problems but to achieve the next level we needed computers to solve strategic problems. The best way to train them was to teach them to play games as games are very much strategic in nature and the kind of thinking that was considered beneficial as it would give a structure to solve other strategic problems. This was believed by a computer scientist Arthur Samuel who created a computer program that played the checkers game.</p><p><strong>The Checkers Game</strong></p><p>Arthur Samuel was an American Pioneer in the field of computer gaming and artificial intelligence. He created the world’s first self-learning program that played the checkers game on its own. He chose this game as it was simple and gave him the opportunity to focus more on learning patterns while he was working at IBM he developed this program by implementing the first Alpha Beta pruning algorithm. This algorithm uses the search tree method and Minimax strategy until now computers had gathered the capability to store data and predict output but since it was 1957 they were almost about to learn how to see when an American psychologist named Frank Rosenblatt designed the perceptron.</p><p><img src=\"https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/60b13f395e70ff270e5f6bc0/Arthur-Samuel-and-his-checkers-playing-IBM-computer-in-1956/960x0.jpg?height=350&amp;width=620&amp;fit=bounds\" alt=\"Arthur Samuel\"><br><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/gilpress/2021/05/28/on-thinking-machines-machine-learning-and-how-ai-took-over-statistics/?sh=270014cc2513\">Source: Forbes</a></p><p><strong>The Perceptron</strong></p><p>Perceptron is a neural network compound of a single artificial neuron. It was designed with biological principles after being inspired by the concept of the Mcculloch-Pitts neuron and the Hebbian theory. This machine was designed for image recognition. The artificial neuron in a perceptron had a number of inputs where each input had a weight associated with it. So, the total input a neuron gets will be the weighted sum of all of the inputs and its related sum exceeds the threshold value the neuron will fire.</p><p><img src=\"https://news.cornell.edu/sites/default/files/styles/story_thumbnail_xlarge/public/2019-09/0925_rosenblatt_main.jpg?itok=SE0aS7ds\" alt=\"Perceptron\" width=\"634\" height=\"357\"><br><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://news.cornell.edu/stories/2019/09/professors-perceptron-paved-way-ai-60-years-too-soon\">Source: Cornell Chronicle</a></p><blockquote><p>“…the perceptron is the embryo of an electronic computer that will eventually walk, talk, see, write, reproduce itself, and be conscious of its own existence..” -New York Times,</p></blockquote><p>Well it does feel a bit too much but again is it really that different from what we see in newspapers nowadays. This model was based on binary classification which means it could distinguish between two classes. However it function under the linear classification but failed in non-linear one. This limitation of perceptron brings us into the next stage of machine learning history where Marvin Minsky enters the picture once again. He identified the loopholes in perceptron that essentially led to the AI winter.</p><p><strong>The AI Winter</strong></p><p>AI winter was a phase when almost all research was stopped as Marvin Minsky criticized Rosenblatt’s perceptron in his 1969 book titled ‘Perceptron an Introduction to Computational Geometry’. It was quite discouraging for the industry to say the least. Adding on to it was the failure in fulfilling the hyperbolic expectations made by the AI industry as far. this prompted the investors and government bodies to withdraw funding leading to AI winter that lasted from 1974 to the 1980’s. Then in 1986 a cognitive psychologist and computer scientist Jeffrey Hinton came as a savior. He provided a solution to the perceptron problem bringing in a Renaissance in the industry.</p><p><strong>Renaissance in 1986</strong></p><p>Hinton co-authored a paper titled ‘<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~vincentp/ift3395/lectures/backprop_old.pdf\">learning Representations by Back Propagating Errors</a>‘ in which he disproved Minsky’s criticism of the Rosenblatt’s perceptron. He proposed that if a group of perceptrons is combined in a neural system with hidden layers. A perceptron can perform classification under a non-linear function. Any mathematical function can be converged in this manner. As a result the AI industry changed dramatically. A critical flaw in Rosenblatt’s perceptron was suddenly fixed resulting in a boom in AI. Further in 1989, Yan Lee Cun, regarded as the father of convolutional neural networks created a device that could recognize handwritten digits. This device annotated zip codes by looking at the images of written digits and employing a neural network with the back propagation algorithm. This stood as a landmark achievement in computer vision. Later on experimenting with gaming was still carried out to make the machines better in making strategic solution. Chess was yet another game that computers were taught to play, and this was also the first time in 1997 that a computer triumphed over human.</p><p><strong>The day a computer won</strong><br>The Feng-hsiung Hsu a graduate student was working on his dissertation project chip test. He was creating a machine that could play chess later when he started working with IBM researchers. He continued to develop this chess playing game with his associate researcher and the deep blue scientists. To teach the machine various chess moves this team gained the support of U.S chess master Joel Benjamin. Joel assisted the Machine by compiling a list of moves that the machine could use during the day. He also played against the machine so that the team could identify its flaws. However when this machine played its first game against world chess champion Garry Kasparov in 1996. It got defeated by two points. The team went back to the drawing board and worked on improving the machine’s ability and created a new version of Deep Blue that could consider a staggering 200 million options per second. Finally in 1997 IBM’s deep blue computer defeated World chess champion Garry Kasparov.</p><p><img src=\"https://imageio.forbes.com/blogs-images/thumbnails/blog_983/pt_983_2851_o.jpg?format=jpg&amp;height=600&amp;width=1200&amp;fit=bounds\" alt=\"Garry Kasparov\" width=\"633\" height=\"407\"><br><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidewalt/2011/05/03/kasparov-vs-deep-blue/?sh=1fcbcc5c30f8\">Source: Forbes</a></p><p>It was during this time when the importance of data for machine learning was realized by few researchers. While many of the 21st century researchers focused on machine learning models in 2006 a computer scientist from America Fei-Fei Li prioritized working on datasets that could change the way we thought about models. As a result around 2009 she devised the concept of ImageNet.</p><p><strong>The ImageNet 2009</strong></p><p><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.image-net.org/update-mar-11-2021.php\">ImageNet</a>&nbsp;is a data set of images organized for its use in visual object recognition. Today it offers approximately 15 million labeled images in 22000 categories. This project was inspired by two important needs in computer visions. Firstly the growing demand for high quantity object categorization and secondly the critical need for equipped resources to conduct good research. This initiative by Fei-Fei Li aided many deep learning and neural network researchers by providing them with the labeled image data sets that they so desperately need. This annotation of large amounts of data sets was carried out with the help of crowdsourcing by using Amazon’s mechanical turf. Since then the ImageNet project has held an annual software contest called the ‘ImageNet large-scale visual recognition challenge’. The goal is to develop models that could perform the best on this data set or simply identify objects with the lowest error rate. In 2012 Jeffrey Hinton and his team competed in this ImageNet challenge and reduced the error rate to nearly half to that of the previous year’s competition winners. So, what did they do? Well, they use GPU Hardware with a deep learning algorithm. This resulted in better ImageNet performance. Following this great Victory many researchers began to work in this field. Companies such as Apple, Amazon, and Facebook became more interested in this technology and an ecosystem began to follow.</p><p><strong>Hike in the Field</strong></p><p>Initially working to create accurate road maps by extracting data from satellites and street views. In 2009 Google started working on self-driving technology after the success of Anthony Levandowski’s self-driving car Prebot which was featured in Discovery Channel’s show ‘Prototype This’. This project was later renamed as Waymo and went on to become a starter in 2016. They were acquired by Google and are now a part of alphabet. The DeepMind company which was acquired by Google in 2014 developed an artificial Go player a machine that defeated world champion Lee Sedol in Go and game that is far more complex than chess. The victory of DeepMind’s Alphago urged many scholars and thinkers to consider the use of artificial intelligence in various Fields. It’s presence and operations on our daily lives made us wonder if machines can really think?</p><p><strong>Are Machines Really Thinking?</strong></p><p>During this time a filmmaker named Oscar Sharp created a short film named&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://youtu.be/LY7x2Ihqjmc?si=RqaPgE_bHBrrbkLg\">Sunspring</a>&nbsp;that is written by an AI system. The modem that created the screenplay used text prediction technology that we see today in smartphone. Another technology like IBM Watson can be seen as a chatbot in any service provided applications where it acts as a virtual assistant. It is a question answering machine that generates insights from large amounts of unstructured data using natural language processing and machine learning. Now, along with thinking the other question was whether these machines could get creative and guess what that too was attempted when computer scientist Ian Goodfellow introduced GAN (Generative Adversarial Network) in 2014.<br>It is a learning model that learns and discovers patterns from inputs resulting in a new set of updates. The model can create a new set of artworks by combining two different images. Also the very recent invention developed by open AI could create images with textual descriptions. It is a type of prompt engineering. I’m sure you must have seen at least a couple of images developed by this AI program named&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://openai.com/dall-e-2\">DALL.E 2.&nbsp;</a>It is capable of creating images of real as well as fictional object.</p><p><img src=\"https://images.openai.com/blob/8a2b0833-55f2-44d6-bf4f-85f9471078f5/Anastronautridingahorseinaphotorealisticstyle9.jpg?trim=0,0,0,0&amp;width=2000\" alt=\"DALLE 2\" width=\"382\" height=\"382\"><br><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://openai.com/dall-e-2\">Source: DALL.E 2</a></p><p>The image that you see here is the result of the text prompt ‘An astronaut riding a horse in photorealistic style’. DALLE illustrates how imaginative humans and clever systems can collaborate to create new things there by increasing our creative potential. However, it looks like this is just the beginning because on 29 September 2022 meta just announced their prompt based video generation tool called make-a-video right alongside other similar independent or open projects like synthesis.io and rephrase.ai. The main question here is ‘Is AI really thinking?’ The short answer is no.</p><p>The current state of AI is the same as any other use of computation. It does what humans ask it to do and humans need to be very specific about what they ask for. Every good AI model out there is really good at only one thing meaning that the AI that draws your drawing does not order your birthday cake just because your mom forgot to but yes the future is exciting and we would love to be on the ride.</p><p><iframe title=\"YouTube video player\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/9LLr4_KXar4?si=Obdsp4n9i7UGg9lj&amp;controls=0\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></iframe></p>",

But all the old economy advocates now stand corrected as even oil giants are trying to get on the bandwagon and get into every small crevice possible of online retail. This means two things. One, that the online world is leading to an expansion and also probable saturation, and two, that you are probably late for the party! Don’t worry, here are the few things you need to take care of before you launch your business online and get into Ecommerce.</p><p>The first thing that you need is PRODUCTS. It kind of seems a little obvious, but we can guarantee you that there hasn’t been a single month when we haven’t received a call asking, ‘hey, I want to start selling online and making money. What should I sell?’ In our previous blog, we spoke about two types of online sellers the brands and the traders. And keeping true to that, the survivors of the online movement are more probably going to be brands than the traders themselves. And that’s because e-commerce, and more importantly, platforms like Amazon and Flipkart have essentially changed the way business is being done.</p><p>The second thing that you need is MARGINS. Unlike retail Ecommerce is capital intensive and the only difference here is that most of your capital expenditures are actually spread out through individual orders and are not supposed to be paid upfront. There are a couple of factors that you do need to consider before starting your complete Ecommerce operations. For example, in Ecommerce you need to worry about</p><ul><li>Photography</li><li>National delivery</li><li>Payment gateway or marketplace commissions</li><li>Packaging</li><li>Storage</li><li>Customer returns</li><li>Refunds</li><li>Advertising expenses</li></ul><p>Thus, if you want to make money online, you need to have a margin somewhere between 40 to 50% for most categories, the more the better.</p><p>Thirdly, you need to have decent CAPITAL EXPENDITURE to get yourself going for at least six months while you’re bearing all of the expenses. We know that saying this might shatter a few dreams right there, but the fact remains that starting yourself on ecommerce is not as easy as those ads would like you to think. Rather starting is technically easy. But surviving, thriving, and succeeding consistently is sure as hell not.</p><p>The fourth and the last thing that you need is quite intangible, but important nevertheless. And it is VISION AND PATIENCE. This being a very serious business had it been really that easy, almost everyone involved in this would have been extremely successful. The fact is, they are not! 80 to 90% of sellers are bound to fail. We have seen people do extremely great in terms of their top line, but eventually fall off the map just because they treated the platform like a trade and did zero brand building behind it.</p><p>We also know that there are a lot of success stories out there talking about guys who made tons of money by bringing unbranded crap from China, but I’ve also seen the same guys struggle with making money and in the end have to resort to putting in wrong product dimensions only so they could save some money on the shipping. But that kind of thing doesn’t fly. In the end, the marketplace ends up charging them, and rightly so. Selling non-branded generic stuff on platforms like Amazon is now a sucker’s bet, in our opinion.</p><p>Because of the barrier of entry being so low every quarter. You will obviously have some Tom, Dick and Harry trying to come up and undercut your prices, only to go bust in a couple of months and hurting you permanently in that process. What this tells us is that opening an online store is very similar to opening a physical retail store. You need to build a relationship with the customers that inspires confidence about not just your product, but also your brand within their minds.</p><p>The only difference and upside of ecommerce is that once you standardized certain parts of your Capex and you get them in control, you are now not limited to a geographical location for selling your products. You can sell in Delhi by sitting in Bombay, or you can also sell in Chennai. Or if you’re really, really proactive, you can actually sit here and sell in the US, all the while building a brand that actually carries value so that in the future you are not limited to just one single product. So, try to BUILD something. Happy selling.</p><p><iframe title=\"YouTube video player\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/crCFc64wFeg?si=W0JRQPNF-zDnLCXJ&amp;controls=0\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></iframe></p>",

Most big box retails generally do that. It’s just that they have a word for slapping a brand name on something generic. They call it white labeling or in house brands or any other new word that might be there. But what we do want you to be worry about is the general attitude of ride the wave. We have seen a number of examples of hand sanitizers during lockdown whose quality barely would surmount as possible in any ordinary day. But just because we are in such a lockdown in such a pandemic situation, anything that they’re providing to us right now is something that we have to bear with. As expected, during the pandemic, there’s a sudden rise in the manufacturers of PPE or personal protection equipment’s for the medical staff mostly, and we are all fine with this so long as generally the quality is maintained.</p><p>But the main question is, even though the requirements of PPE kits is in swing right now, will your new business be able to outlast the lockdown itself? Not to mention that the quality may or may not be in question, since this was not your primary source of business up until like the last four weeks or so. All of this is only under the assumption that you are just trying to make hay while the sun shines, especially during a time where this is not your primary competitive area, but you are just trying to make a quick buck or do some business just in order to probably pay your bills or keep the lights on.</p><p>These worries are not just limited to medical supplies. Even if you talk about trading with essential items like food, pulses, household products, is a pandemic or a panic buy really an excuse for a business plan? Not to mention the fact that there are already players in the market who themselves are struggling to take their products right through their distributors or their customers. If you are thinking about launching a business of essential services or goods and products in this eye of the storm, that’s quite fine. But before you jump in, make sure you have answers to a couple of most basic questions mentioned below. even if you are not launching it in such a time.</p><ol><li>Would I be able to maintain my clients even after the lockdown is lifted and the original suppliers of my client are able to resume full operations?</li><li>Will my clients be able to pay me in time right now so that I can reinvest in my own business or scale up the operations?</li><li>Will I be able to maintain my prices as well as profit during a business as usual situation where none of the lockdown is affecting my business directly or rather, there is no lockdown for that matter?</li></ol><p><iframe title=\"YouTube video player\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ewu6VkMwfmQ?si=5AiI5VA3HqX00Asz&amp;controls=0\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></iframe><br>Building a business takes time, effort, and sure, some luck. You may be strategically placed to take advantage of the skewed supply and the acutely high demands, but this leverage will not last forever, so it’s better to start planning for a normal future while basking in an abnormal present. That’s all for today. As always, you can always follow us on the below profiles. Get in touch with us in case you have any questions.</p><p>Don’t be afraid to reach out to us.

But before we get there, let’s just take a quick look at what Jio has to offer, really. Now, at first, you need to save this number right here in your phone.&nbsp;<i><ins datetime=\"2024-02-12T12:13:23+00:00\">+91 88-5000-8000</ins></i></p><p>What that does is, it becomes a part of your contact, which is the gateway for essentially ordering from Jio. This might not be a surprise as most Indians are already on WhatsApp. The close tie up with Facebook is actually reflecting in the entire user experience, since WhatsApp is also owned by Facebook. As you can see, once you save the phone number, all you have to do is follow the steps given below. go into WhatsApp, send a Hi, and Jio, or the bot really, sends out a temporary link.</p><ol><li>Go on WhatsApp and send a ‘Hi’ to Jio or the bot really.</li><li>Click on the registration link that you will receive on the chat. (link is supposedly active only for the next half an hour.)</li><li>Enter your details like mobile number, address and region (currently, the region is limited to areas in Mumbai, Navi-Mumbai, and Thane.)</li><li>Scroll through the list on the costume menu page and select the products that you wish to purchase.</li><li>Place your order.</li></ol><p>As you can see, the prices are quite fair with some decent discount on some grocery items. But the main concern is what actually came after this. While I was initially under the impression that JioMart is actually going to deliver the products at our home, I was quite surprised when I came to know that I have to be the one who has to go and pick up the products from the store as of now, which, again, I guess it’s fine during pandemic.</p><p>I’m still not sure if this is the permanent arrangement or is only related because of the COVID-19 pandemic going on and overall supply chains being dried up and delivery people not being there. Now, when we actually reached at the grocery store or the Kirana Dukan, we came to know that Jio had actually not sent the products to them, which is why they were not able to sell those products to us, at least not at that very price. The understanding that I got from the Kirana store owner was that Jio is supposed to give the products to these guys, and they will then sell these specific products at the specified prices to us.</p><p>Now, he did have almost all of the products that had already ordered from the app, but they were, of course, not able to honor the pricing that was mentioned there, which eventually meant that the sale actually didn’t grew, not at least through Jio. I feel that the overall launch was rushed. Maybe because of the whole announcement of Facebook investment, maybe they wanted to show what a large scale level pilot would look like or maybe they just wanted the media to know that, yes, they’re still ahead of the game.</p><p>Be that as it may, I foresee JioMart to be a formidable opponent in the food delivery space, especially the groceries. So you can think about Grofers, Swiggies or Big baskets. I think It’s time that all of these people need to be a little more scared to be a part of this market which is already extremely cutthroat. A full-fledged app might be just around the corner. Maybe they’re waiting for this whole COVID pandemic to wear off, or maybe it was just sort of a large scale public beta, backed by the investment news. I don’t know, but I’m more than happy and excited, and I look forward to this.</p><p><iframe title=\"YouTube video player\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/gJdw0mAEDj0?si=NDSUgLWYTpkhUuAy&amp;controls=0\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>",

It was something far simpler—and far more alarming: a power outage.\n\nFor two hours, thousands of businesses around the world lost access to Microsoft services. They couldn’t retrieve data. Their cloud services went offline. All because of one thing: electricity.\n\nAt first glance, it might seem like a minor hiccup. But it’s not. This was a glimpse into what might become one of the biggest challenges of our AI-powered future.",

So, in case you haven’t checked out the first blog, you can do so right&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.esycommerce.com/blog/\">here</a>.</p><h4>Store Design EBC/A+:</h4><p>To stand out on ecommerce platforms you need to focus on things like EBC/ A+ and store design, especially on a platform like Amazon. In order to call yourself a brand legally, you need something called a registered trademark. Having the R mark on your logo means that you and only you have the right to use this logo as you please and the use of your logo by anyone else is downright illegal. This is essentially a brand protection exercise to protect you, the owner of brand, from counterfeit products or any kind of misleading advertisement by any of your competitors or say, disgruntled employees. In addition to brand protection, this trademark certificate, once submitted to Amazon, helps you to build something called an EBC or enhanced brand content. It is also known as A+ listing. Now still, there is a slight difference between EBC and A+, but for now you don’t need to worry about that.</p><p>In addition to that, registering your brand on Amazon also gives you the right to publish what is called a brand store. This brand store is essentially like a mini website on Amazon. It gives you a decent amount of freedom to design the web page as you please so that it reflects the ethos of your brand and your products. You can put in categories, subcategories, banners, images, links, you name it. The point of this feature is to make sure that brands stand out from all other traders on the platforms.</p><p>This feature is really cool being customizable on Amazon. As you know, for brands, pricing is the last concern. They want their customers to understand them and the values of the products that they provide. You can find below some references of EBC and stores that we have designed for our clients so far.</p><p><img src=\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/abs-image-upload-na/6/AmazonStores/A21TJRUUN4KGV/5cadb6720df3b5827df52c7182bd4a99.w3000.h1200._CR0%2C0%2C0%2C0_SX1280_SY487_.png\" alt=\"Kishco \"><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.amazon.in/stores/KISHCO/page/31AC57CC-D427-49F8-B599-775C7D72B1DD?ref_=ast_bln\">Source: Amazon</a></p><p><img src=\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/stores-image-uploads-eu-prod/e/AmazonStores/A21TJRUUN4KGV/c4d7e15ea39f9fe78423e6fefbe89aae.w3000.h600._CR0%2C0%2C3000%2C600_SX1920_.jpg\" alt=\"SagunaBaug\"><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.amazon.in/stores/Saguna+Baug/page/CB547899-2FFE-4428-810F-49D13412EF28?ref_=ast_bln\">Source: Amazon</a></p><h4>The Mock Drill:</h4><p>Now that you have great pictures, excellently keywords listings, beautiful EBC and an amazing store, it’s time for you to run a mock drill. To be honest, we have never needed to do this ourselves for our clients because the kind of handholding that we do provide, they can just directly launch and start selling. But for all of the DIY enthusiasts out there, I highly recommend that you run a mock drill and have your friends and family order a couple of your products. This gives you a unique opportunity to iron out the kinks in all of your backend. At the same time, it gives your friends and family the opportunity to review and rate these products so that an honest feedback helps you get better.</p><p>That being said, these good reviews and ratings go a long way on platforms like Amazon and even your own website. Since trust is the biggest factor why people do or do not buy on independent websites These initial shipments give you the confidence necessary before you jump into the next stage.</p><h4>The Advertising:</h4><p>The next step is advertising. We have almost never come across a client who understands how deeply advertisement is needed in order to establish your brand’s presence online, and honestly, we never understood this outlook. Maybe it is the Internet’s fault to make it look like almost everything out there is free. Trust me, if it’s free, then, my friend, you are the product.</p><p>The simple premise for the need of advertising is this. Let’s say you decide to open a shop right on the street. When you buy or set up a store, you pay more for the store facing the streets. At the same time, you pay much less for renting a store that is nestled somewhere deep inside the building, very much away from the eyes of the passersby. You might even get a larger space for the same amount of price. But why do you pay such a hefty premium for essentially the same deliverables, at least when it comes to the space and the size? The answer is advertising. Everything that you pay, apart from the standard fee, is what you pay for the eyes that cross the streets every day. When you face the streets and show off your existence to the walking crowds, the chances of you making a sale go up dramatically. It is impractical to expect people to buy from a store they do not know exists, let alone cannot see at all. Similarly, just because you launch your store online does not make you any special in the barrage of this endless global market. So, unless people know of your existence with the use of marketing and advertising, you, my friend, are not going anywhere. The typical advertisement budget is supposed to be kept around 20% of your target GMV. GMV is gross merchandise value or to put it in simple terms, the gross sale that you want to make.</p><h4>Customer Delight:</h4><p>Basically the next crucial part is to manage sale and the customer response. Let’s say your hybrid mix of marketing and advertising with online and offline sources has worked wonders and you got your first order, then the second and the third, and so on and so forth but that does not mean that your work stops. It has merely begun, because now is the time you need to focus on one thing and one thing only, and that is customer delight. Try to get good reviews, good ratings from all of the customers that you have served so far. You can officially and formally ask them to rate and review your product and share their experiences so that you can get better with time. You can also consider sending your products to a couple of influencers and have them chime in about the quality of your products on social media. That also helps you to obviously get a good reputation online. That will eventually drive your sale.</p><p>The last part of it all is REPEAT. Yes, that’s it. All you need to do is repeat all of these steps, one after the other, while you are eventually getting better at them.</p><p>Yes, of course there are a lot of other integrities involved in this whole process and as you grow, your problems will only increase and so will hopefully your sale. But all of these things are one of those that can be learned along the way. Plus, we are always there to help you out in case you need anything, right? These ten commandments for ecommerce will never fail. You know them, understand them and share them while seeking more from the people around you so that you end up adding value in your product and your service.</p><p>That’s all from us in this two part series. In our next blog, we are going to go a little light and take a look at how ecommerce has changed the entire retail landscape forever. Till then, if there’s anything for us to learn, make sure that you put that in the comments down below. If you really loved it all, make sure you share this on your social media.</p></div><p><iframe title=\"YouTube video player\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ieg5_zaydUw?si=zNcb5Tt6D8URrxVP&amp;controls=0\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></iframe></p>",

Today I am going to take you a little deeper into the specifics of online selling.</p><p>The first thing you need to take care of in order to register yourself, or let’s say start selling online, is the registration. Now, there are two types of registration. One is registering with the marketplace on which you are willing to sell. For example, Amazon, Flipkart, Pepper Fry – you name it. The second place where you need to get yourself registered is the payment gateway. Now, you need a payment gateway to be integrated on your website so that you can actually process online payments. Payment gateways are companies that enable online transactions on your website. For example, CC Avenue, PayU Money, Paytm for that matter and even some banks also provide payment gateways to be integrated on websites. You can build your website in WordPress, OpenCart, Magento. Then, there are DIY platforms like Shopify and Wix. But then again, we have a certain preference and we will talk about it much deeper in our separate blog that talks about starting your online store.</p><h4>Documents:</h4><p>Contact details, Bank details, Business proofs and Personal proofs are the basic documents that you generally need in order to register with any of the&nbsp; marketplaces or even a payment gateway, for that matter. Importantly,&nbsp; having a Registered Trademark can benefit you by all means. A Registered Trademark Certificate isn’t compulsory as such, but it is extremely crucial for brand building as you get access to Amazon’s Store Design and EBC/A+ functionalities. More on that in a bit.</p><h4>Warehousing (Space, Manpower &amp; Packaging):</h4><p>Since you will initiate your operations by shipping from your facility for almost all the platforms, make sure that your warehouse is well ventilated, managed and staffed along with basic hardware like a Computer, Thermal Printer, two Internet connections and UPS power back up. You will also need to order packaging material and allied stationery like corrugated boxes, cartons, bubble wrap and cello tapes. You will also need to order the boxes and tapes from the marketplaces as they need to have the marketplace branding on them.</p><h4>Product Cataloging:</h4><p>The third thing that you need to do is product cataloging. Now, while your warehouse preps up, you need to do some basic cataloging at your end. This means simply making an Excel sheet of all of your products with some basic information like the product name, product color, their sizes, the prices, and additional details like the barcode numbers and some descriptions, etc. Make sure you have some unique SKU(Stock Keeping Unit) codes in case you don’t have a barcode. That being said, I would highly recommend you get barcodes for your products since it makes it extremely easier to manage your products across all platforms.</p><h4>Photography (Product &amp; Lifestyle):</h4><p>Now you’ll be needing two types of photographs: products shots and lifestyle or creative shots. Product shots are supposed to be done with models for categories like apparel and accessories. For all other categories, they are done without models but on a plain white background with at least four angles: front, back, side, and detail. Here are some examples of creative and lifestyle shots. They have models using the products and also have products in creative background settings. A lot of people cheap out on the photography part. But you shouldn’t do that. Most brand owners do not realize that customers cannot feel your product in their hands. A good picture and in some cases, video, is the only way your customer can experience your product and understand it before making a buying decision. And if you cheap out here, you can just say goodbye to your online domination.</p><h4>Pricing:</h4><p>While your teams are getting the cataloguing and photography done, you now have to take a paper, pencil and calculator and crunch some numbers. You have to figure out your Maximum Selling Price, Effective Selling Price, Discounts and Promotions after accounting for factors like Marketplace or Payment Gateway commission, delivery, storage and advertising. Apart from this, you also have to consider the return ratio of your product category. For example, the return rate for apparels is around 20 to 30 percent. You can find Amazon’s commission structure by clicking on this&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://sell.amazon.in/fees-and-pricing\">link</a>. All you have to do is enter your product details, your pricing, your category, etc., and the national shipping destination, and you will get a rough estimate of the final payout. You can checkout Flipkart’s payment structure&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.digicommerce.in/flipkart-seller-fees-calculator/\">here</a>. You also have to look over things like EBC store design, advertising, and much more.</p><p><iframe title=\"YouTube video player\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/dTqJhQe-JWs?si=SGe1D86yqiuPD694&amp;controls=0\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></iframe></p>",

A web of relationships, acquisitions, and power moves that are reshaping the AI industry. \n\nLet’s zoom in into the timeline.  \n\nIt’s the July of 2024, and the AI landscape looks somewhat like a big web diagram. Tech giants like Microsoft and Google are racing to dominate this up-and-coming field and you will see a repetitive patter emerging. People are moving. And not just any people, these are founders and key players. And they’re not moving to small more exciting startups with a lot of potential. They’re moving up the chain, they’re moving to the boring big sluggish tech giants. \n\nLet’s rewind a little bit over here and come back to 2010 \n\nThree researchers (‎Mustafa Suleyman, ‎Demis Hassabis, ‎Shane Legg) founded a company called DeepMind. Fast forward to 2014, and Google all of a sudden acquires them. This pattern of tech giants absorbing AI talent isn’t relatively new as you can see, but it is accelerating. \n\nNow, let’s come back to 2023.\n\nLast year Mustafa Suleyman, one of Google DeepMind’s original co-founders, had left Google and co-founded a company called Inflection AI. In a sudden move, Mustafa leaves Inflection AI along with his entire core team to join Microsoft and becomes the CEO of Microsoft’s Consumer AI division. This isn’t just a single job change. It’s a seismic shift in how companies do business especially when they see blood in the water. Blood in the form of artificial intelligence. \n\nBut here’s where it gets really murky.  \n\nAnother Inflection co-founder, Reid Hoffman comes into the picture. Now he’s not just any tech entrepreneur. He sits on the board of Microsoft.   And while he sits on the board of Microsoft he’s also investing in AI startups that use Open AI’s technology – a company that Microsoft themselves are heavily invested in to the tune of $10 billion. Do you see the conflicts rising? \n\nFortune Magazine covered this in December 2023 that Hoffman is one of those high-flying VCs who have served on the board of major tech companies while also backing AI startups through their own investment firms. And you see this web of conflicts really stretches far beyond just one or two players. look at Marc Andreessen over here. A general partner at Andreessen Horowitz. One of the most influential venture capital firms in Silicon Valley. Andreessen sits on Meta’s board. But here’s where it gets a little murky. His firm has poured hundreds over millions of dollars into OpenAI, Mistral AI, and Character AI and All of these companies are direct competitors to Meta’s own AI efforts. \n\nBut it doesn’t stop there. \n\nKleiner Perkins, another heavyweight in the VC world, has invested in Together AI. A generative AI cloud platform company. Sounds innocent enough right? Not when you see that Kleiner Perkins’ chair, John Doerr, sits on the board of Alphabet – Google’s parent company. \n\nAnd guess what? Google Cloud is a direct competitor to Together AI. \n\nThis isn’t just about a few isolated cases. It’s sort of a pattern if you zoom out and its repeating itself across the entire AI industry. Venture capitalists, board members, and executives are play multiple roles, often with competing interests. And just as we were researching about this growing pattern of acquihire in the industry, Amazon just happened to make another power move. It snatched up a massive chunk of Adept, a red-hot AI startup that was seen as a serious competitor to OpenAI. We’re not talking about a couple of engineers here . Amazon snagged a whopping 66% of Adept’s entire team! Now, Adept wasn’t exactly some basement operation. These guys were the real deal. Just last year they raised 350 million from some of the biggest names in Silicon Valley. Bringing their total raise to a cool 400 mil  \n\nNow the question we need to ask is how can these individuals make unbiased decision when they have stakes in competing companies and more importantly what does this mean for Innovation Fair competition and the overall future of AI? \n\nOpen AI internal drama \n\nOpenAI, once a non-profit research lab, is now at the center of its own drama. Recently, Open AI’s research scientist and Co-founder, John Schulman left Open AI and Joined Antrophic, an AI startup that’s famously backed by Amazon.  Also, a few months back Co-founder Ilya Sutskever the same guy who wrote the Revolutionary paper that sort of got the whole generative AI thing going along with a key safety team member Jan Leike left open AI. Whistleblowers alleged that the culture of recklessness and secrecy sort of mars the entire origination.  \n\nAnd remember Elon Musk? He too co-founded OpenAI but left in 2018, citing conflicts of interest with his work at Tesla. \n\n![image (1).png](https://res.cloudinary.com/dvnmujzxe/image/upload/v1743078352/image_1_d39602dfdc.png)\n\nThis tweet hints at a tensions brewing beneath the surface. By the way Dario Amodei is currently the co-founder and CEO of Antrophic, he formerly worked as the VP of Research at OpenAI. We have also seen the same AI safety concern during the Open AI drama where Sam Altman was fired and then rehired. Other members of Open AI, like Helen Toner, Tasha McCauley had raised similar sounding concern about AI safety  And they also mentioned that Sam was not consistently candid whatever that means. We actually took a deep dive into this whole OpenAI  saga in our YouTube video here. \n\nDespite Inflection’s recent success and high profile in the AI market, Microsoft’s deal with them is pretty unusual. While it’s not an acquisition, per say Microsoft gains AI expertise without taking any equity or intellectual property from Inflection.  This move also raises questions about Microsoft’s own relationship with OpenAI, which recently listed OpenAI as one of their competitors. Not to mention their potential conflict of interest and the insuing regulatory scrutiny.\n\nRegulatory Scrutiny\n\nAs AI is becoming more and more powerful, the stakes are really getting higher here. These moves aren’t just about talent they are about control. Control over the technology that could actually end up reshaping the world. And it’s not going unnoticed.  The U.S. Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission are watching and they’re not really happy about what’s going on. \n\nMicrosoft has stakes in OpenAI, it has acquired LinkedIn which was founded by Reid Hoffman (that’s how we got the board seat in Microsoft and now he has a deal with Inflection). All the while Microsoft has also invested in Mistral a French competitor to OpenAI. \n\nBut here’s the big question: Is this the beginning of an AI monopoly? Or will the regulators step in strongly to keep a level field.  \n\nThe decisions made in these boardrooms and government offices are gonna essentially alter the way we look at AI in future and also in a way humanity is gonna end up using AI. These issues are not just theoretical. They are happening right now, and they’re affecting real people. People like you and me. As mentioned the Regulators aren’t really asleep at the wheel over here.  Just recently the US justice department has opened an investigation into Nvidia for potential antitrust violations. At the same time the Federal Trade Commission is probing the relationship between Microsoft and openAI. \n\nThe AI power game is intensifying. The question is who would be left standing when the dust settles and more importantly what will it mean for the rest of us? \n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/gg14s_Np0RA?si=nuljc5wFiR4tSmpU\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe>",

The board of directors made a significant decision. They removed Sam Altman, the co-founder and CEO, due to a lack of confidence in his leadership. But how? You see, OpenAI has this unique and a bit convoluted structure to keep the big investors from pulling the strings.</p><p>There are two main parts: OpenAI Inc, a nonprofit run by the Board of Directors, and OpenAI Global LLC, a cap profit company owned by OpenAI Incorporated. Here’s the twist. OpenAI’s rulebook, crafted in January 2016, says that most of the Board of Directors can kick out any director without any warning or formal meeting whatsoever. Just with a little bit of written consent, And obviously, this rule book gave the board a wide power range to pink-slip their own CEO and co-founder. Altman brought OpenAI from nothing to over a $90 billion company, and you would be surprised to know that he owned no shares at all in OpenAI. This is not the first time a CEO was fired from his own company.It has happened before with Apple’s co-founder and CEO, Steve Jobs, Twitter’s co founder, Jack Dorsey, Uber, and many others. But Sam Altman’s saga has much more drama to it.</p><p><iframe title=\"YouTube video player\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/xh4xvyStyqE?si=gMb6FdtxwZYJ8PYx&amp;controls=0\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></iframe></p><h3>Board Fires Sam Altman,<i>&nbsp;17th November 2023, Noon</i></h3><p>On 17th of November 2023, Sam receives a message from OpenAI’s chief scientist, Ilya Sutskever, to join a Google Meet at noon. Sam shows up to the virtual meeting, and there’s the whole board except for Greg Brockman, who is also the co-founder and the President of the company. So things are a little bit strange. Ilya breaks the news to Sam. He’s out. Out of the nonprofit he co-founded and turned into a for-profit behemoth valued at around $90 billion. Soon after Sam’s call, Greg Brockman receives a call from Ilya as well at around 12:23 PM PST, finding out that he was being removed from the board but will remain his role as president, somehow as he was vital to the company. This is why Greg was not present on the fateful call with Sam. He too, was quite blindsided with the entire move. Around 12:30 PM PST, the board put out a blog post on their official website and announced the seemingly haphazard decision. In the blog post title, ‘<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://openai.com/blog/openai-announces-leadership-transition\">OpenAI Annonces Leadership Transition</a>,’ the company declared that Sam Altman will depart as CEO and leave the board of directors as well.</p><p>The reason presented for Sam’s departure was that he was not consistently candid with his communications with the board, hindering its ability to exercise responsibilities. This is corporate lingo for ‘Sam lied to us.’ There was no further clarification to this, and this is exactly where the entire world lost its collective mind. Meera Murati, the company’s Chief Technology Officer, was to serve as interim CEO, effective immediately. She, too, was presented with this news by the board on a very short notice around the same time of the blog post. Bear in mind that Microsoft, the company holding 49% stake in OpenAI’s capped profit entity, had not been informed of this decision until about five minutes before the blog was posted around 12:30 PM PST. All of this within a span of 30 minutes. This corporate governance is unheard of under normal circumstances, but these weren’t normal circumstances. This was a coup.</p><h3>Greg Brockman Quits, 17th November, 2023</h3><p>Meanwhile, Altman acknowledged that he was leaving OpenAI but said nothing about the board’s accusation, instead stating that he will have more to say about what’s next later in a tweet. Now, Microsoft has invested $10 billion in OpenAI by this point and provided its Azure cloud platform to run and scale the processor-intensive models to create ChatGPT, DALL-E, and other products offered by OpenAI.</p><p>Investors at Microsoft could be understandably concerned about this investment, and Satya knew this. At 03:25 PM, PST, Satya Nadella reaffirmed the company’s partnership with OpenAI and its commitment to delivering the benefits of AI technology. While Satya was calming down the investor community at around 4:00 PM, PST, barely 30 minutes after Satya’s tweet, shocked and disappointed by the board’s abrupt move, OpenAI’s co-founder and President, Greg Brockman, shared the message on X, he sent to the OpenAI team about his decision to quit. Brockman tweeted, “Super proud of what we have all built together since starting in my apartment eight years ago. But adding that, based on today’s news, I quit.”</p><h3>OpenAI employees are officially informed about Sam’s dismissal, 18th November 2023</h3><p>The next day, OpenAI’s Chief Operating Officer, Brad Lightcap, sent out a memo about Sam’s dismissal to all OpenAI employees. He categorically mentioned that the board’s choice was not influenced by any wrongdoing or matters related to the company’s finance services, business operations, safety measures, or security and privacy practices. So, if those weren’t the reasons, then what was it that forced the board for such a drastic measure?</p><h3>Investors Support for Sam Altman</h3><p>On the next day, a few other researchers joined hands with their leader and decided to quit, too. As reported by The Information, Jakub Pachocki, the Director of Research at OpenAI, Aleksander Madry, the Head of Team that Analyzes AI Risks, and Szymon Sidor, a researcher who had been at the firm for seven years told associates at OpenAI that they too had quit. Some investors and employees, along with key supporters like Microsoft, Tiger Global, and venture firm Thrive Capital, began inserting pressure on the boards to restore Sam as the CEO again. The biggest names in Silicon Valley took to social media to express support for Altman. The following day witnessed a wave of encouragement for Altman from OpenAI staff, with many others tweeting, “OpenAI is incomplete without its people.” Additionally, several employees responded with heart emojis to another tweet by Altman, affirming, “I love the OpenAI team so much.”</p><h3>Satya Nadella Announces Joining of Altman and Greg to Microsoft, 19th November 2023</h3><p>On Sunday night, Satya Nadela announced the joining of Altman and Greg to lead a new AI research team at Microsoft. It made sense for both Microsoft and Sam and his team to join hands. This protected Microsoft from anguish of their shareholders while also giving a huge leverage to Sam and his team to negotiate his return to the OpenAI with his board. Elon Musk chimed on this news with a tweet saying, “How Sam and Greg will use Teams now instead of Google Meet.”</p><h3>Emmett Shear, OpenAI’s New Interim CEO, 20th November 2023</h3><p>The Monday started with another announcement that OpenAI is hiring Emmet Shear as the new interim CEO of OpenAI instead of Mira. Somehow, OpenAI board managed to fight two CEOs in the span of 48 hours, and yet again, we don’t know why. Anyway, Emmet Shear is the former CEO of Twitch, a video game livestreaming platform. Shear was informed about his hiring on a call he probably received on the late night of Sunday. Following these developments, the OpenAI employees teamed up and gave an ultimatum to the board, outgoing the call. Out of the 770 employees, 738, that’s 95% of the staff, ended up signing a letter asking the board to either step down from their positions or face a mass exodus of OpenAI staff to Sam Altman’s new venture at Microsoft. Among the signatories are some of the most senior executives of OpenAI, including Mira Murati, the erstwhile CTO, and the board appointed interim CEO. At least now we know why the board had to find another interim CEO, right?</p><h3>Ilya Sutskever Regrets, 20th November 2023</h3><p>The bigger shock was Ilya Sutskever, the same Ilya that fired Sam in the first place, along with the other board members, of course. The letter accused the board members of being incapable of overseeing OpenAI. It also revealed that Microsoft has assured the signatories that they would be welcome to join the new subsidiary that Altman is creating if they choose to join. Ilya then tweeted his regret for participating in the board’s decision and explained that he never intended to harm OpenAI, that he loves everything they have built together and do everything to reunite the company. At this point, even Elon Musk questioned Ilya directly, why does he take such drastic decisions? But more importantly, Elon asked, if OpenAI is doing something dangerous, the world needs to know. Sam, Greg, and a few other employees and CEOs appreciated Ilya’s apology on Twitter by sending out heart emojis. Sam Altman, in a series of tweets, communicated a message of unity and commitment towards OpenAI’s ongoing operations and his partnership with Microsoft. In one of those tweets, Altman underscored the shared priority between him and Microsoft CEO, Satya Nadella, to ensure the flourishing future of OpenAI. Considering all the dramatic twists, the board had to take note of it, and now Sam might have to delete this tweet that he posted on Sunday.</p><p><img src=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/F_U2I1abgAA7_G5?format=jpg&amp;name=large\" alt=\"Sam altman leaving openai\" width=\"521\" height=\"694\"><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://twitter.com/sama/status/1726345564059832609/photo/1\">Source: twitter.com</a></p><p>Why? Because finally, the board caved in and OpenAI announced on Wednesday that it has reached an agreement for Sam Altman to return as CEO reshuffled board consisting of Bret Taylor, Larry Summers, and Adam D’Angelo. In this whole story, the main question remained unanswered. Why was Altman fired in the first place? The internet is no stranger to conspiracy theories, so here are more refined ones.</p><h3>The Conspiracy theories</h3><ol><li>“Not Consistently Candid”- According to the board’s blog post. Sam was not entirely truthful with the board members regarding something. Either there was probably a blatant lie a white lie or maybe a lying by Omission. Maybe the AI is sentient of something and he didn’t tell the board yet. This is quite unlikely since such developments are almost impossible to keep under the wraps in a company with 770 employees or maybe the board was hinting towards Sam other extracurricular activities like building a chip company with money from Middle East backers to build a chip that is focused on AI and can compete against the likes of Nvidia.</li><li>Quora me This: Poe.ai?- Another theory is that board member Adam D’Angelo’s company Quora launched an AI Marketplace called POE back in December 2022. Earlier in the month Sam launched GPT Marketplace on OpenAI’s dev conference making it a direct and arguably a superior competitor to Quora’s own solution rendering POE kind of obsolete. And he did it quite quickly right under the board’s nose or maybe Sam did promise not to launch it and did it any way angering D’Angelo leading up to his firing. But this Theory got canned by the middle of the week since D’Angelo is the only board member who was not replaced not to mention that firing Sam needed a majority of the board members to be in favor. I doubt they’d fire Sam just because Quora is also valuable to them. right?</li><li>Staged- The third theory is a bit out there that says all of this was staged to change the nonprofit status of OpenAI and solidify it’s for-profit status by giving the CEO the powers of a typically funded for-profit startup not unlike Facebook or Microsoft in its early days. This seems a bit unfeasible since it needs to be choreographed and coordinated to the team. Also, how many people are supposed to be in on it even the big names taking Sam’s side on Twitter. Public opinion could have swung in either direction right. Especially given what Elon shared later in the conversation. If this is true is the unverified letter shared by Elon a part of the setup or despite it or was it a last Fighting Chance against whatever was happening behind open a closed doors. The letter that Elon shared allegedly sent to him by a group of anonymous ex-employees says things like, “We believe that a significant number of OpenAI employees were pushed out of the company to facilitate its transition to a for-profit model this is evidenced by the fact that OpenAI’s employee attrition rate between January 2018 and July 20120 was in the order of 50% Throughout our time at OpenAI&nbsp; we witnessed a disturbing pattern of Deceit and manipulation by Sam Altman and Greg Brockman, driven by their insatiable pursuit of achieving artificial general intelligence AGI. Their methods, however, have raised serious doubts about their true intentions and the extent to which they genuinely prioritize the benefit of all Humanity. This is quite a daming testimony if it is true. If you want to see the whole thing for yourself, you can find that letter&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://board.net/p/r.e6a8f6578787a4cc67d4dc438c6d236e\">here</a>.</li></ol><p>The whole Fiasco was born out of worries by Tasha and Helen who thought that Sam was maybe getting too commercial with OpenAI. Maybe stay too far away from the original Mission of the nonprofit that was supposed to be more responsible towards AI development for the good of the world or was it some kind of superiority complex stemming from their effective altruism background. At least Vinod khosla of khosla venture definitely seems to think so when he said,</p><blockquote><p>“..there are some errent people on the board who misinterpreted their own religion around EA or effective altruism..”</p></blockquote><p>Whether Tasha and Helan had legitimate fears on legitimate grounds or if it was mere a shocking and errant Behavior as Mr Khosla puts it, we might actually never know. But it might be too soon to write about Tasha and Helen because, if you read the article by The Information and Reuters, Sam and his team seemed to be on a huge breakthrough in the artificial general intelligence side of things, to the extent that Sam himself had to say this on stage at the Asia Pacific economic cooperation Summit in San Francisco,</p><blockquote><p>“four two times now, In the history of OpenAI the most recent time was just in the last couple of weeks. I’ve gotten to be in the room we sort of push the veil of ignorance back and the frontier of Discovery forward, and getting to do that is the professional honor of a lifetime..”</p></blockquote><p>This was one day before he got fired by the board. Yeah so that happened! either way it’s all conjecture at this point because what matters now is that the ultimate winner here is Microsoft. They strongly projected two things. They have full access and control of the two hottest Commodities in Tech, OpenAI the organization as well as the maker of the tool, Sam Altman. This showed the world and its investor that Microsoft is going to maintain its lead in AI and associated tools. It’ll be interesting to see if this image holds up or will they stand challenged by expected and unexpected players if you too are committed to the AI mission in your organization feel free to reach out to us for all things AI on kshitij@esycommerce.com.</p>",

      "Shortdescription": "On 17th of November 2023, Sam receives a message from OpenAI’s chief scientist, Ilya Sutskever, to join a Google Meet at noon. Sam shows up to the virtual meeting, and there’s the whole board except for Greg Brockman, who is also the co-founder and the President of the company. So things are a little bit strange. Ilya breaks the news to Sam. He’s out. Out of the nonprofit he co-founded and turned into a for-profit behemoth valued at around $90 billion. Soon after Sam’s call, Greg Brockman receives a call from Ilya as well at around 12:23 PM PST, finding out that he was being removed from the board but will remain his role as president, somehow as he was vital to the company. This is why Greg was not present on the fateful call with Sam. He too, was quite blindsided with the entire move. Around 12:30 PM PST, the board put out a blog post on their official website and announced the seemingly haphazard decision. In the blog post title,",

This race for AI supremacy has added another layer of drama to the industry. A month ago, we saw OpenAI making some uncertain situations, including the hiring and firing of CEO and co-founder Sam Altman. We have the whole OpenAI saga in our previous&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.esycommerce.com/blog/\">blog.&nbsp;</a>Now let’s shift our attention to Google’s DESPERATE move with the introduction of Gemini, an advanced iteration of their generative AI models, which was later integrated into their bar chatbot. We’ll explain why it came across as desperate further in the blog.</p><p><strong>What exactly is Gemini?</strong></p><p>Google officially announced Gemini in a&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://blog.google/technology/ai/google-gemini-ai/#sundar-note\">blog post</a>&nbsp;published on the 6th of December last year. According to Google DeepMind, Gemini is an ‘Anything to Anything’ model. It can generate diverse outputs in response to multiple types of inputs, which means it’s multimodal in nature. As a multimodal large language model, Gemini is built to display reasoning across different types of information such as text, images, video and audio, including computer code written by humans. In contrast to OpenAI’s Chat GPT, which is primarily a text based chatbot, Gemini is supposed to not only respond to text prompts, but also provide answers and reasoning. By understanding images, text, audio and video, Gemini is also capable of generating real time responses by examining video or image feeds, explain reasoning in math and physics. It was also shown to have the ability to live track moving objects. Additionally, Gemini can understand, explain and generate high quality code in programming languages like Python, Java and go. It’s ability to work across languages and reason about complex information makes it, in theory, one of the leading foundation models for coding in this world.</p><p><strong>Gemini has its three variants.</strong></p><p>The first version of Gemini is available in three variants, ultra Pro and nano. Ultra for handling high complexity tasks, Pro for improved performance and deployability at scale, and Nano for on device applications like smartphones, smartwatches, face ware. Gemini Ultra is the first model to surpass human expertise in massive multitask language understanding, or MMLU, a widely adopted benchmark assessing the knowledge and problem solving capabilities of AI models. That’s quite a big deal in the field of AI because MMLU is a series of tests that use a combination of 57 subjects like math, physics, history, law, medicine, ethics for testing both real world knowledge and real world problem solving capabilities, Gemini scored a whopping 90% on that test.</p><p><strong>Natively Multimodal</strong></p><p>The best part of Gemini is that it is natively multimodal. It has been pre-trained on multimodalities from the very beginning. The team presented Gemini with a mix of various modalities incorporating both images and text. Gemini then responded to make predictions about what could come next. It was tested on logic and reasoning by showing images of the earth, the sun and Saturn so that it could arrange it in the right order or to test its cultural understanding. It was shown a few still images and asked to guess the movie. To test it on object detection and tracking, it was presented with the classic ball and cup shuffling game where it answered correctly under which cup the ball was placed.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dvnmujzxe/image/upload/v1746352380/matrix_charades_90e0e7c4ad.png\" alt=\"matrix_charades.png\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dvnmujzxe/image/upload/v1746352380/thumbnail_matrix_charades_90e0e7c4ad.png 245w,https://res.cloudinary.com/dvnmujzxe/image/upload/v1746352380/small_matrix_charades_90e0e7c4ad.png 500w,https://res.cloudinary.com/dvnmujzxe/image/upload/v1746352380/medium_matrix_charades_90e0e7c4ad.png 750w,https://res.cloudinary.com/dvnmujzxe/image/upload/v1746352380/large_matrix_charades_90e0e7c4ad.png 1000w,\" sizes=\"100vw\" width=\"1600\" height=\"220\"></p><p><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://developers.googleblog.com/2023/12/how-its-made-gemini-multimodal-prompting.html\">Source: GoogleBlog</a></p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dvnmujzxe/image/upload/v1746352450/cup_shuffle_2_and_3_ae0766c1e3.png\" alt=\"cup_shuffle_2_and_3.png\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dvnmujzxe/image/upload/v1746352450/thumbnail_cup_shuffle_2_and_3_ae0766c1e3.png 245w,https://res.cloudinary.com/dvnmujzxe/image/upload/v1746352450/small_cup_shuffle_2_and_3_ae0766c1e3.png 500w,https://res.cloudinary.com/dvnmujzxe/image/upload/v1746352450/medium_cup_shuffle_2_and_3_ae0766c1e3.png 750w,https://res.cloudinary.com/dvnmujzxe/image/upload/v1746352450/large_cup_shuffle_2_and_3_ae0766c1e3.png 1000w,\" sizes=\"100vw\" width=\"1600\" height=\"395\"></p><p><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://developers.googleblog.com/2023/12/how-its-made-gemini-multimodal-prompting.html\">Source: GoogleBlog</a></p><p><strong>Fake Demo Video?</strong></p><p>Although this&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://youtu.be/UIZAiXYceBI\">demo</a>&nbsp;video shared by Google seemed interesting, it is a bit disappointing that it was a wee bit staged and edited. So was it all fake? Well, not exactly. You see, everything that we see in this video was done through text prompts given to it and not the voice commands that it shows, which does not really take anything away from Gemini’s abilities to process multimodal data. Gemini’s ability to seamlessly combine these modes together enables new possibilities for what you can do.</p><p><strong>Benefits of Gemini</strong></p><p>As discussed by Google’s software engineer Taylor Applebaum and research scientist Sebastian Novazin, Gemini can help in fields like science and finance. From around 200,000 research papers on genetics, Gemini filtered out 250 relevant papers and highlighted the key data, and this was done within the time of a lunch break. Gemini can not only understand research papers, but being multimodal, it can also understand numbers and figures and create a new, refined version of it. This multimodal capability can help in understanding various forms of financial data, including charts, graphs and textual information. This versatility allows for a comprehensive analysis of financial reports and market data, contributing to a well informed financial strategy.</p><p>Gemini can also process raw audio signals as is. Typically when an LLM model interacts with audio, it runs it through a speech recognition system to convert it into text, and then it feeds that text into another model that understands and processes it. In this process, some of the nuances of pronunciation or tone could obviously be lost. But as explained by Google DeepMind’s research scientist Adria Rekha sense, Gemini can understand and reply on raw audio signals end to end. For example, with its audio capabilities, Gemini could be helpful for enhancing the experience of watching, say, a YouTube video. It’s ability to directly understand and respond to raw audio signals could be leveraged to provide real time, accurate, multilingual subtitles. This would eliminate the need for an intermediary step of converting a spoken language to text and then translating it. Users could enjoy videos in their preferred language without losing nuances of the original content, and this could probably be done real time. Also, for the viewers with visual impairment, Gemini could help with audio description as well. Gemini might also be helpful in wearable tech like the ray ban meta sunglasses, wherein users can interact with their smart glasses through natural speech. They can also receive spoken translation in their preferred language as Gemini can understand the nuances and pronunciations of voice accurately.</p><p>What if I say that it can also help us with your homework? Yes, it can, as explained by Google DeepMind’s interaction designer Sam Chuang, if you show it a handwritten mathematical problem, Gemini can understand it, point out the mistakes, as well as provide you with a solution. Gemini’s ability to understand handwritten mathematical problems enables it to assist students in solving complex equations. It can be a versatile tool for grasping complex academic concepts. Students can receive prompt feedback on their academic work, promoting a more dynamic and interactive learning experience. Further, more Gemini might also help in fields like rocket science and climatology to correct their fallacies and predictions.</p><p>Gemini can go beyond text interface. Instead of coming up with generic answers, it can understand user intent and reason with a personalized interface that is crafted and adapted to suit the specific needs desired by the individual or organization for whom it is created. Google deep mind’s engineering director, Palash Nandy, showed how Gemini can help in planning an event. When asked about a suggestion for a kid’s birthday party who loves animals,<br>Gemini comes up with an outcome that is visually rich and interactable. Nuances in similar questions, but with fundamentally different environments could generate better, non-repeated solutions. For instance, determining the amount of additional exercise required is dependent on individual factors such as one’s current fitness routine, professional objectives, and personal goals. Gemini could help with creating a personalized fitness plan. A professional athlete might necessitate a different exercise plan compared to someone who is working in banking. Similarly, appropriate decor for your daughter’s birthday celebration would vary significantly depending on whether it’s her third birthday or a Quinceanera.</p><p><strong>Multimodal AI Future?</strong></p><p>While this technology may seem impressive and positioned as a formidable competitor to OpenAI’s chatgpt. The edited demonstration video of Gemini only offers an approximation of its potential functionality. The showcased features are not currently available in the precise manner presented in the video shared by Google. The question arises: why did Google stage this demo video? Let’s try to unfold why Google might be so desperate to introduce its upgraded model.</p><p>After OpenAI launched chat GPT, it reached 100 million users only in 2 months, which was almost 5 times faster than TikTok that took 9 months to reach 100 million active users and 10 times faster than Instagram that took almost 2 years to reach 100 million users. Google launched its chatbot bard in February 2022 but failed to display its competency. As a result, Alphabet s shares went down by 8%. But similarly, alphabet’s stock price increased by 5.3 percentage points in a single day after Gemini was introduced. While all of this is noteworthy, we should not overlook the fact that Google has been synonymous with the internet for the better part of two decades now. And it’s not without reason – Google has served as a substantial repository of videos and links to legitimate websites with informative articles. Essentially, these are knowledge bases intricately connected to the internet, ensuring that only the best information ascends to the top of the search result page. This holds true for every single query it generates. Not to mention the agility with which it poses answers and solutions to each query. So, understanding this, Google deeply understands relevance – discerning which piece of data is more legitimate than the other. This unique position renders Google highly reliable as an LLM model.</p><p>Furthermore, despite ChatGPT gaining significant traction and forming partnerships with Microsoft as it morphs as a co-pilot and in related services, it’s understandable that these primarily serve as B2B services for large corporations, functioning more as internal tools. Simultaneously, the consumer front is predominantly dominated by Google, given its access to the largest user base connected to the internet through its android program. This implies that, to a greater extent, Google can penetrate the B2C market more easily than ChatGPT ever could.</p><p>Considering these factors, even though Google’s shares saw a temporary 8% dip, we are witnessing the formation of two distinct trajectories. Google is poised to maintain a strong hold on the b2c market when it comes to LLMs, while ChatGPT is carving its niche in the b2b realm with Microsoft. Historically being a b2c company, Google can shrug off the market response to ChatGPT and others because of its own deep integration capabilities into android and their stronghold on general search.</p><p>So, Is chat GPT is at risk due to Gemini? Not at all. Because the data shows that Gemini is competing with GPT 4, but soon OpenAI will be coming up with gpt5. And that is where it gets interesting. Not to mention the fact that Chat GPT holds its own 100 million monthly active users. In addition to Microsoft and Google, there are other major players who could potentially play an increasingly important role in the AI sector in the coming years.</p><p>One of them is amazon, who has its own AI platform called titan bedrock AI. As many of you may already know, Amazon Web Services (or AWS) has the largest market share in the cloud computing segment. Another notable player is apple. It already has its own large language model that its engineers are using internally, referring to it as ‘AppleGPT’. Last but not the least, there s Facebook or Meta. Meta recently launched llama 2, a foundation language model that is offered with a commercial license and is available for free as one of the best open-source models. This move underscores Meta’s commitment to AI and its role as a major player in this space.</p><p>The introduction of Google’s Gemini marks a significant stride in the evolving landscape of artificial intelligence. Positioned as a multimodal large language model, Gemini goes beyond traditional text interfaces, showcasing the potential to answer questions across diverse inputs such as text, images, video, audio, and code. The model’s capabilities, as demonstrated in an albeit staged, but impressive video, encompass real-time responses, code generation, even surpass human experts in massive multitask language understanding. Multimodal seems to be the future and we are excited to be on the ride.</p><p><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZagsN2gI9PE?si=vX6pKZLzWU9pYMaP\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></p>",

      "Shortdescription": "The AI sector is undergoing a generative revolution as tech giants like Google, Microsoft, Apple and Meta are competing to build a new generation of AI models that prioritize a human centered approach. This race for AI supremacy has added another layer of drama to the industry. A month ago, we saw OpenAI making some uncertain situations, including the hiring and firing of CEO and co-founder Sam Altman. We have the whole OpenAI saga in our previous blog. Now let’s shift our attention to Google’s DESPERATE move with the introduction of Gemini, an advanced iteration of their generative AI models, which was later integrated into their bar chatbot. We’ll explain why it came across as desperate further in the blog.",
