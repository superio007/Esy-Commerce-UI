Altman’s responded that he finds it a little hopeless! Satyam’s former CEO, CP Gurnani, wasn’t about to take this lying down. He tweeted that he accepts the challenge. \n\n![image.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/dvnmujzxe/image/upload/v1743073317/image_386a375efd.png)\n\n Altman tried to explain, by  saying that he was talking about India’s funding capacity, and not the potential of Indian AI enthusiasts. But if you think about it critically, you might realize that Sam was kind of right. Before we dive into the numbers, let’s rewind and understand how we exactly is we got here. How did AI Involve into this tech juggernaut? \n\n**Importance of Research**\n\nThe current AI hype, powered by these Large Language Models or LLMs,  started with a research paper. It came from the University of Toronto, authored by Geoffrey Hinton- the “Godfather of modern AI” – along with Ilya Sutskever of Open AI fame and Alex Krizhevsky (that’s where the name AlexNet comes from). They took an old AI algorithm and sort of supercharged it using just two NVIDIA GPUs. \n\nBut here’s the key word: RESEARCH. How many Universities do you know  in India known for their cutting edge, competition winning or patent awarded, commercially implementable research in Artificial Intelligence? \n\n**India’s Resource Constraints**\n\nIndia does not have the resources; because India ALWAYS exports it’s best resources.\n\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/mlNBw7HfvG0?si=w3I-ANy4moEs4DqB\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","Title":"Why India will NEVER create ChatGPT OpenAI o1 Preview | India vs Silicon Valley in AI Development","createdAt":"2025-03-27T11:44:38.268Z","updatedAt":"2025-03-27T11:44:38.268Z","publishedAt":"2025-03-27T11:44:38.814Z","Shortdescription":"Can India REALLY compete in the AI wars?
