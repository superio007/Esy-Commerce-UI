            taken in the matter, the employee concerned will be required to take

            conflict of interest that ought to have been disclosed by the
            employee, the management would take a serious view of the matter and
            consider suitable disciplinary action against the employee,
            including termination of employment and recovery of any damages.

            Every employee of EsyCommerce shall promptly report to the
            management any actual or possible violation of the Code or an event

            Employee relationships
          </h3>
          <p>
            We want to ensure that relationships between employees are
            appropriate and harmonious. We outline our guidelines and we ask you
            to always behave professionally.
          </p>
          <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6">Fraternization</h3>
          <p>
            Fraternization refers to dating or being friends with your
            colleagues. In this policy, “dating” equals consensual romantic
            relationships and sexual relations. Non-consensual relationships
            constitute sexual violence and we prohibit them explicitly.
          </p>
          <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6">Dating colleagues</h3>
          <p>
            If you start dating a colleague, we expect you to maintain
            professionalism and keep personal discussions outside of our
            workplace. You are also obliged to respect your colleagues who date
            each other. We won’t tolerate sexual jokes, malicious gossip and
            improper comments. If you witness this kind of behavior, please
            report it to HR.
          </p>
          <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6">Dating managers</h3>
          <p>
            To avoid accusations of favoritism, abuse of authority and sexual
            harassment, supervisors must not date their direct reports. This
            restriction extends to every manager above an employee. Also, if you
            act as a hiring manager, you aren’t allowed to hire your partner to
            your team. You can refer them for employment to other teams or
            departments where you don’t have any managerial or hiring authority.
          </p>
          <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6">Friendships at work</h3>
          <p>
            Employees who work together may naturally form friendships either in
            or outside of the workplace. We encourage this relationship between
            peers, as it can help you communicate and collaborate. But, we
            expect you to focus on your work and keep personal disputes outside
            of our workplace.
          </p>
          <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6">
            Employment of relatives
          </h3>
          <p>
            Everyone in our company should be hired, recognized or promoted
            because of their skills, character and work ethic. We would not like
            to see phenomena of nepotism, favoritism or conflicts of interest,
            so we will place some restrictions on hiring employees’ relatives.
            To our company, a “relative” is someone who is related by blood or
            marriage within the third degree to an employee. This includes:
            parents, grandparents, in-laws, spouses or domestic partners,
            children, grandchildren, siblings, uncles, aunts, nieces, nephews,
            step-parents, stepchildren and adopted children. As an employee, you
            can refer your relatives to work with our company. Here are our only
            restrictions:
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside mt-2">
              <li>
                [You must not be involved in a supervisory/reporting
                relationship with a relative.]
              </li>
              <li>
                [You cannot be transferred, promoted or hired inside a reporting
                relationship with a relative.]
              </li>
              <li>
                [You cannot be part of a hiring committee, when your relative is
                interviewed for that position.]
              </li>
            </ul>
            If you become related to a manager or direct report after you both
            become employed by our company, we may have to [transfer one of
            you.]
          </p>
          <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6">Workplace visitors</h3>
          <p>
            If you want to invite a visitor to our offices, please ask for
            permission from our [HR Manager/ Security Officer/ Office Manager]
            first. Also, inform our [reception/ gate/ front-office] of your
            visitor’s arrival. Visitors should sign in and show identification.
            They will receive passes and will be asked to return them to
            [reception/ gate/ front-office] once their visit is complete. When
            you have office visitors, you also have responsibilities. You
            should:
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside mt-2">
              <li>
                Always tend to your visitors (especially when they are
                underage.)
              </li>
              <li>
                Keep your visitors away from areas where there are dangerous
                machines, chemicals, confidential records or sensitive
                equipment.
              </li>
              <li>
                Prevent your visitors from proselytizing your colleagues,
                gathering donations or requesting participation in activities
                while on our premises.
              </li>
            </ul>
            Anyone who delivers orders, mail or packages for employees should
            remain at our building’s reception or gate. If you are expecting a
            delivery, [front office employees/ security guards] will notify you
            so you may collect it.
          </p>
          <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6">
            Solicitation and distribution
          </h3>
          <p>
            Solicitation is any form of requesting money, support or
            participation for products, groups, organizations or causes which
            are unrelated to our company (e.g. religious proselytism, asking for
            petition signatures.) Distribution means disseminating literature or
            material for commercial or political purposes. We don’t allow
            solicitation and distribution by non-employees in our workplace. As
            an employee, you may solicit from your colleagues only when you want
            to:
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside mt-2">
              <li>
                Ask colleagues to help organize events for another employee
                (e.g. adoption/birth of a child, promotion, retiring.)
              </li>
              <li>
                Seek support for a cause, charity or fundraising event
                sponsored, funded, organized or authorized by our company.
              </li>
              <li>
                Invite colleagues to employee activities for an authorized
                non-business purpose (e.g. recreation, volunteering.)
              </li>
              <li>
                Ask colleagues to participate in employment-related activities
                or groups protected by law (e.g. trade unions.)
              </li>
            </ul>
            In all cases, we ask that you do not disturb or distract colleagues
            from their work.
          </p>
          <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6">Dress code</h3>
          <p>
            Our company’s official dress code is [Business/ Business Casual/
            Smart Casual/ Casual.] This includes [slacks/ loafers/ blouses/
            boots.] However, an employee’s position may also inform how they
            should dress. If you frequently meet with clients or prospects,
            please conform to a more formal dress code. We expect you to be
            clean when coming to work and avoid wearing clothes that are
            unprofessional (e.g. workout clothes, shorts, sportswear etc.) As
            long as you conform with our guidelines above, we don’t have
            specific expectations about what types of clothes or accessories you
            should wear. We also respect and permit grooming styles, clothing
            and accessories that are dictated by religious beliefs, ethnicity or
            disability.

            This section deals with all things digital at work. We want to set

            and social media to ensure security and protect our assets.
          </p>
          <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6">Internet usage</h3>
          <p>
            Our corporate internet connection is primarily for business. But,
            you can occasionally use our connection for personal purposes as
            long as they don’t interfere with your job responsibilities. Also,
            we expect you to temporarily halt personal activities that slow down
            our internet connection (e.g. uploading photos) if you’re asked to.
            You must not use our internet connection to:
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside mt-2">

          <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6">Cell phone</h3>
          <p>
            We may allow use of cell phones at work. But, we also want to ensure
            that your devices won’t distract you from your work or disrupt our
            workplace. We ask you to follow a few simple rules:
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside mt-2">
              <li>
                Use your cell phone in a manner that benefits your work
                (business calls, productivity apps, calendars.)
              </li>
              <li>
                Keep personal calls brief and use an empty meeting room or
                common area so as not to disturb your colleagues.
              </li>
              <li>Avoid playing games on your phone or texting excessively</li>
              <li>
                Do not use your phone for any reason while driving a company
                vehicle.

              <li>
                Do not download or upload inappropriate, illegal or obscene
                material using our corporate internet connection.
              </li>
            </ul>
            Also, you must not use your phone in areas where cell phone use is

                Signing up for illegal, unreliable, disreputable or suspect

              <li>Spamming other people’s emails, including your coworkers.</li>

            We want to provide practical advice to prevent careless use of
